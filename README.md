Description:
This project simulates 1,000 games of Yahtzee (five dice rolls) to estimate the probabilities of various outcomes such as no pairs, one pair, three of a kind, four of a kind, and Yahtzee. The program uses random number generation, hash tables for frequency counting, and structured game logic to model the dice-rolling process, including up to two rerolls per attempt.

Features:

Simulates up to 1,000 full Yahtzee games

Tracks occurrences of:

No pairs

One pair

Three of a kind

Four of a kind

Yahtzee

Uses unordered_map for efficient frequency tracking

Outputs a formatted results table with both counts and percentages

Implements reroll logic that mimics real Yahtzee strategy (keeping the highest-count value)

Tech Stack:

Language: C++
